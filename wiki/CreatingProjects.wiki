#summary A getting started guide on how to create a project in Simplicity with the current version.

This is a guide to help people get started making projects with PSimplicity with the source version available on this website.

== Steps ==
=== with .pde ===
  # Open a new Processing sketch.
  # Add the following code to your sketch as a template, and then save it again.
{{{
// Name of Project
// Author

Stage stage = new Stage(#FFFFFF);
Sprite mySprite = new Sprite("http://www.majhost.com/gallery/veggieman/scans/frog.png",0,0);

void setup(){
  size(480,360);
}
void draw(){
  Update();
}
void stop(){
  SoundCleanse();
}
}}}
Customise the comments and size to your liking, and then start programming. 
  # Open a new tab in the same sketch and copy and paste Simplicity into it. The source for the latest version is available [http://psimplicity.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Simplicity.pde here].
  # Start coding!

*Note:* _The function `SoundCleanse()` is only necessary if you will be using the `Microphone` or `Sound` classes in your project._

=== with Java ===
*Note:* _You will need to compile yourself or use the compiled library from the SVN, which is usually out of date._
