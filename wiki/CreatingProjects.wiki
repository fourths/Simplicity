#summary A getting started guide on how to create a project in Simplicity with the current version.

This is a guide to help people get started making projects with PSimplicity with the source version available on this website.


== Steps ==
  # Download Simplicity. The source for the latest version is available [http://psimplicity.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Simplicity.pde here].
  # Create a new sketch in Processing. Save it and give it a name.
  # Add the following code to your sketch as a template, and then save it again.
{{{
// Name of Project
// Author

void setup(){
  size(480,360);
  
}
void draw(){
  
  
}
void stop(){
  SoundCleanse();
  
}
}}}
Customise the comments and size to your liking, and then start programming. 

*Note:* The function `SoundCleanse()` is only necessary if you will be using the `Microphone` or `Sound` classes in your project.
