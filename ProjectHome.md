Simplicity is a library for/written in Processing designed to emulate Scratch's blocks and datatypes as functions and classes, for ease of transition to coding.

It is currently not in active development due to the fact that the lead developer is working on other projects, there was little-to-none assistance by others, and had hit a roadblock, but people are welcome to help and the lead developer will work on it as well.
